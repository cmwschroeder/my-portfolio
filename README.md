# My Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is a porfolio that shows my work. It has a navbar that will take you to the various sections on the page, as well as a resume nav link that will open a downloadable pdf of my resume. The sections right below show my picture, and a quick paragraph describing me. Under that you will also find my email address and phone number in a contact section. Under that section is a section featuring four of my strongest projects in the UC Berkeley Full Stack Development bootcamp. These project cards have a link to my deployed application as well as a link to the projects github repository. On hovering over a specific project, the project's image will change from a still image, to a animated gif showing usage of either website. At the bottom is a footer that contains links to my github and my readme.
