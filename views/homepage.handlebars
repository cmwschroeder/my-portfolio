            <p>
              I am a student of the UC Berkeley coding bootcamp. I have previously gotten a bachelors in computer science at UC San Diego but it has been a couple years since then. My plans were put off because of covid 
              for the sake of my family. Now I am getting back into the swing of things and taking this bootcamp in order to refresh and learn more about web design and development. I currently live in Plumas Lake, California. 
              I hope to continue along this career path while becoming the best me that I can be.
